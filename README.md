# NASR mailing list materials repository

## About

This is the repo for IETF NASR-related materials.

NASR is short for Network Attestation for Secure Routing, whose purpose is to develop an architecture that can attest to a network path and verify if the actual traffic followed this path, in the predetermined order. The network path could either be a virtual network path consists of virtual network functions, or an underlay path consists of physical network devices.
