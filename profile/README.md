### Highlight: [Check the Interim Meetings Page](https://github.com/ietf-nasr/NASR-Meetings)

## About

This is the repo for IETF NASR-related materials.

NASR is short for Network Attestation for Secure Routing, whose purpose is to develop an architecture that can attest to a network path and verify if the actual traffic followed this path, in the predetermined order. The network path could either be a virtual network path consists of virtual network functions, or an underlay path consists of physical network devices. 

## Past Events and Current Progress

NASR is actively discussing to form a self-contained problem statement / BoF proposal.

NASR held an non-WG forming Bof at IETF 120 in Vancouver. Material and minutes of the Bof can be found **[here](https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/120/session/nasr)**  

NASR held several side/interim meetings and has planned several interim meeting. The complete schedule of past, current, and future event can be found **[here](https://github.com/ietf-nasr/NASR-Meetings)**
